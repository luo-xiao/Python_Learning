# dataset: Sentiment140 (1.6 million samples of positive and negative sentiment)

# key points in pre-process large data for training:
# 1. read file in segments of 10mb at a time with buffering (instead of reading the entire file)
# 2. save progress as check-point to continue from where we left off (because training takes much longer)
